           Today there was 1 quiz by algorithms.<br>
           To say that it was difficult is to say nothing.<br>
           Of course, we were taught the topics on a couple, but the tasks were very confusing and difficult.<br>
           Probably more than half completed less than or 1 problem out of 6. RIP my good scoreðŸ’”.

           Yesterday was the database midterm exam.<br>
           I wrote it well, but I made some silly mistakes because of my carelessness.<br>
           Therefore, to anyone reading this, always double-check your work before submitting itðŸ˜‰.

           Tomorrow is the last day of the fall semester.<br>
           We have a whole month of rest and I am using it to the fullest.<br>
           I hope I will not forget everything I learned during this time.
